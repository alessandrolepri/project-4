## Project Summary



# Users Journey




## Process

The development process started with simple wireframes to workout the basic functionality of the site. We then decided what database models and routes would be needed. We started working on the backend api of the site by each making models and controllers for every route. Once the api routes had been made, this was tested by making api requests with Insomnia.

With the backend up and running, we moved onto working on the frontend with React.js. Basic components were made for each page and a router was set up in the app.js file. We each took pages and worked on these individually creating the layout and functionality for each page.

Work was carried out on branches of the code depository for each feature. This was merged with the Development branch of the code and any merge conflicts were fixed as a group. Features were tested on the Development branch before being merged with the Master branch.

Tasks were managed and assigned through the task manager Trello. We performed daily stand-ups to keep track of progress.


# Styling

For this app we have decided to use React Semantic UI which help us to design all the major form such as Register, Login and Messages implementing extra style by CSS to deliver the final result as we wanted to be.
