## Project Summary

What if you don’t even know where to start on your story? This app for writers can definitely help.
Inspiration can come from weird places and, now your phone can be one of them!
This app is just like it sounds: an app for writers...and readers
In particular, if you’re looking for a story writing app, READ-ME App is for you. It can help you lay the groundwork for your story, from organising all of your novel’s major events.

## Users Journey

Any users can check all the stories on reddit and also stories published by other users and start reading.
The user reading has than been implemented by converting from text to voice the stories and also set up the night mode that will change the colour of the screen for a less bright screen
If any READ-ME users would like to contact other users by sending messages and leave comment or publish short stories the register form is necessary and by log-in they can start their journey into the app and became a potential writer, join the readers community and, add the stories to the reading list for the future.


## Process

The development process started with simple wireframes to workout the basic functionality of the site. We were using Python with Flask and SQLAlchemy to interact with the postgreSQL database. We used the MVC design pattern to built out the backend.

With the backend up and running, we moved onto working on the frontend with React.js. Basic components were made for each page and a router was set up in the app.js file. We each took pages and worked on these individually creating the layout and functionality for each page.

Work was carried out on branches of the code depository for each feature. This was merged with the Development branch of the code and any merge conflicts were fixed as a group. Features were tested on the Development branch before being merged with the Master branch.

Tasks were managed and assigned through the task manager Trello. We performed daily stand-ups to keep track of progress.


# Features

### Reddit API

We used the Reddit API to pull in additional short stories from the short stories subreddit. This was done using "praw", a wrapper for for the Reddit API using python. We also allow users to save a story from reddit to their reading list, which will also save the short story to our database, allowing users to make comments on it as well. In the future, we'd like to prevent the same reddit story from being added to the database multiple times.

### Night Mode

We thought night mode would be a very useful feature for those who love reading without the eye strain of a bright screen. This feature was achieved by creating a Settings class with static methods which saved the night mode setting in local storage, which would still be useful for if the user left the site and returned later. It was debated having night be stored in the database for each account, however we wanted any user(logged in or otherwise) to have access to night mode.

### Mobile Focused

From the outset, we decided we wanted to make the app heavily focused towards mobile. Since this is an app we envisioned people using while on the commute to work, sitting in bed, or just anywhere on the go. Semantic UI's very good documentation made it even more achievable to do this with a large app on just a seven day timeframe. Because of this mobile focused development, we felt a sidebar would fit very well for this app.

### Flip Effects

This was achieved using a package call 'react-flip-page'. While it certainly was an essential and very useful part of creating the overall look and feel of the site, it was definitely a big challenge to work with and to style correctly.

### Reset Password

![Screenshot 2019-03-12 at 19 04 43](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/42512889/54228443-11a43e00-44fa-11e9-9cba-225f259c8db0.png)

We thought that any App where the user needs to sign-up in order to post their story should also have a "reset password" function to fully complete the authentication process. Our idea was to verify if an email address was already been used and saved in our database in order to get access to the reset password stage. If the value provided is matching the database params.user then the password can be reset and a new token will be assign once log in again.


# Challenges and Wins

### Reading Page

This page was particularly challenging for several reasons, and went through quite a few changes before the final version was settled. The main difficulties were due to the nature of the flip card component and how difficult it was to style correctly. Another difficulty was trying to get each page display the correct amount of words, so as to not flow off the page. This was done on the front end using a for loop. As the story came from the database(or API), it was a long string. I then split the string into an array, spliced it every 800 characters roughly, then placed each long portion into a div which then was styled via media queries to make them appear readable for each mobile size.

# Future features

If we would have had more time our idea was to implement this App with a language translator to let the user choose the reading prefer reading language. Also another extra feature will the email service when the user ask to reset the password, so the user will receive via email the verification link generating a random code to clink on to confirm the email address and then reset your password. Adding the bookmark in the stories was also in our plane and this will help the user to keep reading from the last time.
